    response:
      "The sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by the gases and particles in the Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths being scattered more than other colors, as explained by Rayleigh scattering.",

    response:
      "The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education is the leading typology of American colleges and universities. It is widely used in the study of higher education, both as a way to represent and control for institutional differences, and also in the design of research studies to ensure adequate representation of institutions, students, or faculty. The classifications include all accredited, degree-granting colleges and universities in the United States that are represented in the National Center for Education Statistics IPEDS database.",

    question: "What is the purpose of the Carnegie Classifications?",
    email: "dstraneo2@smugmug.com",
    source: null,
    response:
      "The classifications provide a way for institutions to be compared in terms of their missions and student bodies, not simply on the basis of the number and types of degrees awarded or the amount of research grants and contracts expended. The classifications allow researchers, policy makers, and others to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions to study the ways in which these institutions are different, and how those differences relate to their respective missions and operations. Finally, the classifications are used for administrative purposes at the institutional level",

    email: "jscriviner4@nps.gov",
    source: null,
    response:
      "If your institution is not classified, there could be several reasons. First, an institution must be located in one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, or U.S. territories. Second, an institution must have reported students in IPEDS Fall Enrollment (EF) and Completions (C) for the same year of the Classification (2022). An institution that does not report students is not eligible for Classification.",

    response:
      "Carnegie Classifications are based on the IPEDS data collection cycle. Any changes to the classifications are only made after the U.S. Department of Education has announced that they will accept update requests to the data reported by institutions. For the 2023 update, the window for data updates to IPEDS was February 14, 2023 through April 7, 2023. If an institution missed that window, there will be another opportunity for updates in January/February 2024.",

    source: null,
    response:
      "The research university classification includes institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctorates in 2019-20 and also had at least $5 million in total research expenditures, with at least $3 million in federal research expenditures. It is important to note that these classifications rely on a mix of historical and current data, and are not a form of recognition. Instead, they provide a way to understand the diversity of higher education institutions, and the students they serve.",

    response:
      "The basic criteria for classification among research universities are threefold: having awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctorates in 2019-20, having at least $5 million in total research expenditures (as reported through the National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development Survey) for the 2019 fiscal year, and having at least 20 research staff (as measured by full-time equivalents) in the 2019 fall snapshot.",

    email: "gbeaudry9@wordpress.org",
    source: null,
    response:
      "The original Carnegie Classification was developed in the United States and was intended to reflect the U.S. higher education landscape. Although some of the criteria have been applied to institutions in other countries, the categories and criteria may not be as relevant or appropriate for institutions outside the U.S. For example, the emphasis on the research doctorate is a characteristic of the U.S. higher education system, with no equivalent in most other countries.",
