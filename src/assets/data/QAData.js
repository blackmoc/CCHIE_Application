    Questions: "What is my institution's Carnegie Ranking?",
    Answers:
      "The Carnegie Classifications is a descriptive taxonomy and not a ranking system. Institutions are categorized according to criteria, such that those with similar attributes are in the same category. Although there are 'levels' within the system, for example, degree-levels, and research activity-level, there is no assignment of value to those levels. More importantly, there is not connection between institutional quality and Carnegie Classification. Indeed, the point is to separate institutions into categories within which questions of quality, value, effectiveness, etc., can be more productively considered.",

Researchers need a way to reference the great diversity of colleges and universities in the United States, and classifications enable them to identify groups of roughly comparable institutions.

    Questions:
      "Why only US institutions are classified in the Carnegie Classification?",
    Answers:
      "There are two primary reasons why, thus far, only U.S. degree-granting institutions are included in the Carnegie Classifications: The classifications were developed within the U.S. higher education context, specifically for the purposes of describing the landscape of postsecondary education within the U.S. As such, the concepts and categories were developed specifically for the unique attributes of the U.S. system, including the fact that there are many more private than public institutions and, at least historically, a more diverse array of postsecondary institution types. Practically, the classifications have evolved in ways closely related to the federal accountability data collections, which other countries are not likely to have in the same form. For example, the core data requires publicly available information on degrees conferred by level and by discipline, with the federally maintained Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) taxonomy that is used by all institutions to report degrees using a common taxonomy. No other country has these specific data, in part because they too relate closely to the U.S. context. Another very U.S.-centric component is the National Science Foundation (NSF) data collections regarding research expenditures and staffing.  It is difficult to compare directly research expenditures because of large differences in scale for U.S. research funding compared to most other countries.",

For example, the 2024 updated will be based on academic year 2022-23 degree completions and Fall 2023 enrollment.

We do this because, for most universities, the 'other than tenure/track' faculty with ladder rank (asst, assoc, full) contribute substantially to the generation of grant-funded activity (which includes grants related to research, teaching and service). For example, 'clinical faculty' are a type of non-tenure/track faculty that medical schools employ who often are PIs or Co-PIs on grants. Faculty hired exclusively for teaching are most often ranked as lecturers or instructors, which we do not include.  We understand that universities differ as to who they include among the 'ladder ranks' (asst, assoc, full) and other ranks, but we have to use a model that works best across all institutions.  We conducted analyses in 2014 to decide which number to use before settling on this methodology.",

This inference is reasonable at the 4-year level, but much less so at the 2-year level because the majority of community college students 'including those who may have achieved their educational objectives' do not receive any formal award. As a result, classifying community colleges on the basis of the minority of students who receive a credential would not be representative of the colleges? offerings.

The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education developed the classification in 1973 to support its program of research and policy analysis. Derived from empirical data on colleges and universities, the Carnegie Classification was updated in 1976, 1987, 1994, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2018, and 2021 to reflect changes among colleges and universities.  The framework is used in the study of higher education and are intended to be an objective, degree-based lens through which researchers can group and study similar institutions. Carnegie Classifications are used in research study design to ensure adequate representation of sampled institutions, students, or faculty.",

The Elective Classifications are sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and are managed on behalf of the Carnegie Foundation by an Elective Classification Central Office.  Institutions apply to be recognized by the Carnegie Foundation through a particular Elective Classification theme and make extraordinary commitments to that theme. Elective Classifications are not awards. They are evidence-based documentation of institutional policy and practices focusing on areas such as institutional culture and mission, curricular and co-curricular programming, continuous improvement activities, and the recruitment and reward of faculty, staff, and students.",

    Answers:
      "Institutions that conferred at least 20 research/scholarship doctorates in 2019-20 and reported at least $5 million in total research expenditures in FY20 were assigned to one of two categories based on a measure of research activity. The research activity index includes the following correlates of research activity: research & development (R&D) expenditures in science and engineering; R&D expenditures in non-S&E fields; S&E research staff (postdoctoral appointees and other non-faculty research staff with doctorates); doctoral conferrals in humanities, social science, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, and in other fields (e.g., business, education, public policy, social work). These data were statistically combined using principal components analysis to create two indices of research activity reflecting the total variation across these measures (based on the first principal component in each analysis).  One index represents the aggregate level of research activity, and the other captures per-capita research activity using the expenditure and staffing measures divided by the number of full-time faculty within the assistant, associate, and full professor ranks. The values on each index were then used to locate each institution on a two-dimensional graph. We calculated each institution's distance from a common reference point (the minima of each scale), and then used the results to assign institutions to one of two groups based on their distance from the reference point. Before conducting the analysis, raw data were converted to rank scores to reduce the influence of outliers and to improve discrimination at the lower end of the distributions where many institutions were clustered.

    Questions: "What is the methodology of Associate's colleges?",
    Answers:
      'For institutions that conferred associate degrees as the highest degree level offering, we used the methodology introduced with the 2015 update. First, the institutions were separated according to whether their total awards (associate degrees and certificates), were primarily in one or a few disciplinary fields. These fields were identified according to the first two digits of the CIP* code. Institutions that meet the criteria of being a special focus institutions were classified into one of four Special Focus groups noted below. Two-year institutions not designated as special focus were classified according to the combination of two factors, each divided into three groups (3x3=9 categories total): program mix and student mix.  Because IPEDS does not capture information regarding type of associate degree conferred (e.g., AA, AS, AAA or AAS), we use the field of study for awarded associate\'s degrees and longer term certificates (at least 1 but less than 2 years) as a proxy measure to categorize institutions into one of three program mix groups: high transfer, mixed transfer/career-technical, and high career-technical. This designation was derived starting with the arts & sciences and professions distinction used for classifying baccalaureate colleges. The "professional" disciplines are then further distinguished according to the percent of awards nationally, awarded at the associate degree or less than two-year certificate levels. The CIP codes were then further reviewed and additional ones changed from professional to career & technical if they were in a sequence where the majority were career & technical, or if it was obvious that the field of study was associated with employment opportunities that did not require a higher credential. The detailed disciplinary designations are available in an Excel spreadsheet.  Institutions in which 35.7% or less of awards were in career & technical disciplines were designated as having a high transfer program mix. Those with at least 53.8% of programs in such disciplines were considered as having a high career & technical program mix. Institutions between which 35.7% and 53.8% of awards were in career & technical fields were categorized as mixed transfer/career & technical program mix. This categorization is based on the rationale that the career & technical programs are designed to provide the award recipient with a credential for immediate employment within that field. Awards in other fields (professional and arts & sciences) generally require further education to obtain employment requiring a postbaccalaureate or higher credential in the field. We recognize that many associate\'s colleges offer awards in the specific field, "Liberal Arts & Sciences, General Studies or Humanities" as a "Transfer Degree." However, in this classification, we take a broader view of transfer preparation to include fields in which the terminal associate\'s degree or more than one-year but less than two-year certificate is not sufficient for employment in positions within the field that require a baccalaureate or higher credential. In creating this classification, we recognize that individual states and individual institutions vary in their policies and practices as to whether such non-career-technical fields (by our definition) prepare students for transfer to a four-year institution.  Student mix, within this classification, is determined by a combination of the proportion of total enrollment accounted for by "degree-seeking" students (as opposed to "non-degree" students), and the ratio of fall headcount to annual unduplicated headcount. Specifically, we multiply these two ratios and designate as "high traditional" student focus those institutions for which the product is greater than 0.628. Institutions for which the product is lower than 0.533 are designated as "high non-traditional," and the remaining institutions are designated as "mixed traditional/nontraditional." The student mix index was created by examining the distribution of students within these institutions across the stated variables as well as percent part-time students and the percent students age 25 or older. The derived factor was selected due the comprehensiveness of data availability and the distributional properties that allowed for identification of cutoff points for groups of three roughly equivalent numbers of institutions.',

The trade-off is that they are inherently retrospective\u2014it takes a few years for new programs to show up in the data. There is a time lag until graduates are produced, and a second lag for release of the data reporting those graduates. Similarly, degree data may include degrees for programs that have since been closed.

    Questions:
      "What is the full definition of the Undergraduate Instructional Program Classsification?",
    Answers:
      'The Undergraduate Instructional Program Classification is based on three pieces of information: the level of undergraduate degrees awarded (associates or bachelor\'s), the proportion of bachelor\'s degree majors in the arts and sciences, in professional fields, and in career & technical fields for two-year institutions, and the extent to which an institution awards graduate degrees in the same fields in which it awards undergraduate degrees. All categories in this classification are determined using degree conferral data from the update year (2019-2020).  The distinction between arts and sciences and professional baccalaureate majors is one that has been made in the Classification since 1987 (but only for undergraduate colleges), and researchers and others in the higher education community have also made similar distinctions. We are extending and elaborating the previous analysis by (1) applying it to almost all baccalaureate-level institutions, (2) making finer distinctions along the arts & sciences - professions continuum, and (3) recognizing a "middle ground" where the two domains exist in relative balance with respect to graduating students\' major concentrations.  With the 2015 update, we also added the designation of career & technical programs. These are defined as professional fields (per the baccalaureate designation), in which the majority of awards nationally are at the associates level or lower (certificate programs of less than two-years duration).  A high concentration of majors in the arts and sciences is not the same as a liberal arts education, and we do not view any particular location on this continuum as the special province of liberal education. Examples of high-quality liberal education exist across the spectrum.  Some institutions enroll no graduate students. Others may have graduate programs that operate relatively independently of the undergraduate program (such as a law school). Still others offer graduate education in most or all fields where they have undergraduate programs, and, of course, some institutions fall between these extremes. By examining the number of undergraduate fields in which we also see graduate degrees (as determined by overlap in the Department of Education CIP* codes under which baccalaureate and graduate degrees are recorded), we can locate institutions along this continuum of undergraduate-graduate "coexistence." Departments that teach only undergraduates can differ in many ways from those that also train graduate students. Examples of such differences include faculty activities and instructional resources.',

    Questions: "What is the meaning of  Undergraduate Program Mix?",
    Answers:
      "In past updates of the Carnegie Classifications, Arts & Sciences and professional fields were generally defined at the 2-digit level of the CIP. With the 2015 update, we expanded that definition to the full 6-digit level of CIP codes. In most cases, the CIP codes for an entire 2-digit domain have the same designation. However, with this change, we have more comprehensively aligned the different field classification schemes used for associates degrees and less than two year certificate; baccalaureate degrees; and graduate degrees. The Completions data allow for up to two majors per degree, and we used information from both majors (thus the denominator in the percentage calculation is the total number of majors, which can be greater than the total number of bachelor's degrees because of double majors). The mapping of fields of study to arts & sciences or professions is documented in this Excel file.  We assigned associates institutions to one of three categories, grouping the corresponding categories of the basic classification. High transfer includes institutions in which fewer than 35.8 percent of awards (associates degrees and less than two-year certificates) were awarded in vocational & technical fields (see the Basic Classification methodology for more details). At the other end of the spectrum, high vocational & technical includes institutions in which 53.5 percent or more of the awards were conferred in vocational & technical fields. The remaining associates colleges were designated as \"mixed transfer/vocational & technical.\"  We assigned four-year institutions to one of five categories based on the proportion of bachelor's degrees awarded in arts & sciences and professional fields. Institutions with at least 80 % of bachelor's degrees in arts and sciences or professional fields were assigned to the corresponding \"focus\" pole of the continuum, and the remaining schools were assigned to the middle categories according to most majors (with the boundaries set at 60 % of the corresponding domain). The middle category thus includes institutions with 41 to 59 % of bachelor's degrees in each domain.",

    Questions: "What is the Graduate Instructional Program Classification?",
    Answers:
      "As a companion to the Undergraduate Instructional Program classification, this classification examines the nature of graduate education, with a special focus on the mix of graduate programs across fields of study. In this classification, a single graduate-level degree qualifies an institution for inclusion. The classification is based on the level of graduate degrees awarded (master's degrees, and doctoral degrees categorized as either research/scholarship, professional practice, or other doctorate), the number of fields represented by the degrees awarded, and the mix or concentration of degrees by broad disciplinary domain. The classification has two parts: one for institutions that award at least one research/scholarship doctoral degrees (hereinafter referred to as research doctoral degrees), and one postbaccalaureate degree-granting institutions that either offer only master's degrees or that also offer professional practice or other doctoral degrees (based on the record of degree conferrals, not program offerings). Within each group, we then classify institutions with respect to the breadth of graduate offerings and the concentration of degrees in certain fields or combinations of fields.  For two categories of institutions offering research doctorates, we distinguish institutions offering medical education (defined as human or veterinary medical education, including allopathic medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine). Institutions in other categories may also offer medical education, but the numbers were not large enough to justify subcategories, and we judged it preferable to differentiate with respect to the other graduate fields, rather than with respect to the presence or absence of medical education.",

These were the most current data available for all institutions. The advantage of using degree data is that degrees are reliable artifacts of instructional activity, and they permit detailed analysis by field of study. The trade-off is that they are inherently retrospective\u2014it takes a few years for new programs to show up in the data. There is a time lag until graduates are produced, and a second lag for release of the data reporting those graduates. Similarly, degree data may include degrees for programs that have since been closed. Whatever time period is used, there will always be some schools where program changes are too recent to be reflected in the degree data.",

      "Colleges and universities that offer graduate training but that do not award research/scholarship doctorates are identified as having 'Postbaccalaureate' graduate programs, because they include both master's programs and professional programs (such as a law school, medical school or other professional doctoral program). Among this group, an appreciable number offer graduate training in a single field. We classified these institutions separately, identifying those specializing in education, business, or another single field (education and business account for the largest share of master's degrees nationally). Next, we identified those institutions with comprehensive offerings as indicated in the record of conferrals, where \"comprehensive\" is defined as awarding at least one master's or professional/other doctoral degree in each of the following disciplinary domains: humanities, social sciences, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and one or more professional fields (such as business, education, engineering, health professions, public policy, or social work). The remaining institutions were separated into those whose offerings span arts & sciences and professional fields (including a small number with graduate programs exclusively in the arts & sciences) and those whose graduate programs are exclusively in professional fields. Finally, we divided each of these groups according to the plurality of degrees (arts & sciences, education, business, and other professional fields).",

Older students also generally face special challenges related to the competing obligations of school, work, and family. For two-year colleges, the proportion of students enrolled part-time is based on all undergraduates. For four-year institutions, it is based on degree-seeking undergraduates. Among institutions that confer baccalaureate degrees, entrance examination (SAT or ACT) scores describe\u2014with notable limitations\u2014the academic preparation of entering first-year students, which in turn corresponds to the selectivity of undergraduate admissions. Although we do not take this as a gauge of institutional quality, admissions test scores and selectivity are widely used by institutions, academic researchers, and others in determining the comparability of colleges and universities. For all the criticisms of standardized tests, they provide the only comparable, widely available metric for students' prior academic preparation and achievement. Average institution-level entering test scores are also highly correlated with institutional-level graduation rates (typically around r=0.85). As an increasing number of selective institutions implement a 'test-optional' admissions policy (and therefore do not report test scores through the IPEDS admissions component), we added as a backup measure of selectivity, the proportion of applicants that were offered admission, noting that this too is an imperfect measure. A measure of transfer origin identifies institutions where many undergraduates enter as first-year students and progress to graduation, as compared with those where an appreciable number of students begin their college careers elsewhere. Serving larger numbers of transfer students has a number of implications, such as the planning and assessment of general education, student advising, the structure of majors, and so on. At schools admitting large numbers of transfer students, test score data based on the first-time first-year population may not adequately describe the undergraduate population as a whole. For some institutions, analysis of aggregate student enrollments in the Undergraduate Profile Classification can conceal the fact that two distinct programs and student populations are included. These institutions offer relatively distinct undergraduate programs\u2014one serves a student body consisting of recent high school graduates who typically attend full-time and who reside on or close to campus (often living with other students), while the other program focuses on degree completion for returning students. Students in degree completion programs typically have families and full-time jobs, and they may attend part-time and commute to school or enroll online. For such institutions, the undergraduate profile classification may not accurately characterize either program.",

    Questions:
      "What are the Achievement Characteristics/Selectivity for a Four-Year Undergraduate Profile?",
    Answers:
      "Institutions that enroll baccalaureate degree seeking students are distinguished according to their admissions selectivity into three groups: inclusive, selective, and more selective. Institutions report SAT and/or ACT scores if those scores are required as part of their admissions policy. For these institutions the selectivity designation is based on test scores. For test-optional, or test not required institutions that are do not indicate that they have an open admissions policy, the designation is based on percent of applicants admitted. Open admissions institutions are all placed into the 'inclusive' category. When entry test scores are used, the measure is based on the distribution of entrance examination scores for each institution's first-time first-year students. Each institution reports its 25th and 75th percentile figures for the SAT Verbal, SAT Math, and ACT Composite. For schools that reported both ACT and SAT scores, we created a weighted composite score based on the proportion of students who submitted each type of test score. Fractional composite scores were rounded to the nearest whole number. Although the intent of the undergraduate profile classification is to describe the undergraduate population, it is difficult to label groups based on test scores in a way that does not lead to inferences of relative quality. The three groups correspond to 25th percentile ACT-equivalent scores of less than 18, 18-21, and greater than 21. Among schools that did not report test score data to IPEDS, some are open admissions, while some are selective based upon different criteria. Institutions that indicated they have an 'open admissions' policy were put into the 'inclusive' groups. For those institutions that are not open admissions but do not require/report test scores, we used the percentage of admitted students according to the number of applications received. Close approximations to the quartile ACT-equivalent scores were found with 'more selective' institutions admitting 55% or less of their applicants, and 'inclusive' institutions accepting 80% or more. The middle group was considered 'selective.' Because very few \"medium full-time\" institutions qualified as 'more selective,' the 'selective' and 'more selective' groups were combined. Similarly, there was insufficient variation on the score variable to justify sub-dividing the group with the largest percentage of part-time students.",

      "What is the Transfer Origin for a Four-Year Undergraduate Profile?",
    Answers:
      "The measure of transfer origin was only used for four-year institutions. IPEDS now includes in their Fall Enrollment collection the distinction between 'First time', 'Transfer-ins', and 'Continuing' students. We used these to calculate transfer enrollees as a percentage of all entering undergraduates (first time plus transfer-ins). The calculation is based on FTE students (full-time headcount plus one-third part-time headcount) for both first time and transfer students.",

    Questions: "What is the definition of the Size and Setting Methodology?",
    Answers:
      "Size matters. It is related to institutional structure, complexity, culture, finances, and other factors. Residential or nonresidential character reflects aspects of the campus environment, student population served, and the mix of programs and services that an institution provides. Four-year institutions are divided into four categories of full-time equivalent (FTE*) enrollment and three categories of residential character. Neither characteristic implies differences in the quality of undergraduate education, but an institution's location along the two continua generally corresponds to a distinctive mix of educational challenges and opportunities. Because few two-year institutions serve a residential population, these institutions are classified solely based on FTE enrollment. The residential character measure is based on two attributes: the proportion of degree-seeking undergraduates who attend full-time and the proportion living in institutionally-owned, -operated, or -affiliated housing. It is important to note the variety of situations of students who do not live in college or university housing. Some are true 'commuting' students, while others may live with other students in rental housing on the periphery of campus, and still others are distance education students who rarely or never set foot on a campus.",
